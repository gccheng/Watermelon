1. Use the Mahalanobis distance, yield better results
2. Is the high probability event almost nomal?  NO!
--> The limitation of the method used: didn't consider the temporal relationship  
--> Solution:(S1) For time window w1, compute the average probability, compare.... (S2) Within a larger time window W2(n*W1), the pdf(w2) should be consistent with pdf(training)--KL divergence
